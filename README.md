# rrf-voron2
RepRap-firmaware for Duet and my Voron 2.4

This is mostly a backup storage gor my Voron2 Duet RRF-configuration

# Do not use this without understanding what it does. It can destroy your printer!!

# Yes, it has a working version of AutoZ
But you really need to understand how it works and adjust to your config. I can 100% say that it will NOT work on your unless you adapt it.

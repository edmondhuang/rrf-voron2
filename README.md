# rrf-voron2
RepRap-firmware configuration for Duet/Voron 2.4

This is a backup storage for my Voron2 Duet RRF-configuration. It is not a complete reference configuration. 
Some files are obsolete, untested, to be removed or changed. Use it at your own risk only. 

# Please, Do not use this without understanding what it does. It can destroy your printer!!

# It has a working version of AutoZ
It updates the baby-step value to the probe offset.
You really need to understand how it works and adjust to your config. It will NOT work in your configuration unless you adapt it and probably you will bend some extrusions.
